# Blog - A Warmup

##### What is this about?

This tutorial was created as part of a Workshop held at [UPRM](http://www.uprm.edu/portada/) to help people who are new to Web Development, get up to speed on some of the concepts. By no means is this a complete introductory guide into Web Development, just a means to get people started on the subject. Some very basic slides are included to guide through some of the concepts of web development.

##### Tech Stack

In order to run this project you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed as well as an instance of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org) running. Modules used to run this project are:

* [hapiJS](http://hapijs.com)
* [handlebarsJS](http://handlebarsjs.com)
* [mongoDB Driver](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native)
* [mongooseJS](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html)
* [Vision](https://github.com/hapijs/vision)

Each of these modules have great documentation and installation guides.

##### Installation

	$ cd /path/to/directory
	$ git clone https://github.com/sezalcru/blog-warmup.git
	$ cd blog-warmup/
	$ npm install
	$ npm start
	
As previously mentioned, in order for the project to run, an instance of MongoDB must be active in the user system.

##### Special Thanks

To [@jpadilla](https://github.com/jpadilla) for [Juicebox](https://github.com/jpadilla/juicebox), using juicebox we skipped all the installation and got straight to the code, all with the same env. If you would like to use this project make sure to head on over to [http://jpadilla.github.io/juicebox/](http://jpadilla.github.io/juicebox/).

##### Where to go from here?

I strongly recommend heading over to the Ruby on Rails site and spending some time reading, if not learning, their platform. Why? Because they are based on strong, proven web fundamentals. For further reading on HTML5, CSS3 or JavaScript head over to [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). They have great documentation on most of the web concepts.
